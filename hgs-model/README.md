3D model of the Handheld Ground Station.

Helical Antenna Segment:
	These files are designed to be 100mm on it's longest axis (height).
	It is designed to be printed standing up, with the pins at the top.

	Four of these segments make up a single antenna.

	Works fine with 20% infill, but increasing the wall thickness is recommended,
	especially to fill the pegs.

	Models were originally created with Solidworks. .SLDPRT files, and exported .STL files will live here.

	Dimensions:
		Diameter 39.5mm
		Body Length 93mm
		Peg Length 7mm
		Peg Width 20mm
		Alignment Peg Width 4mm
		Peg Hole Extra Clearance 0.5mm

Backplane:
	Backplane for the antenna, other components attach to it as well.

	Dimensions:
		Minimum Diameter 92mm
