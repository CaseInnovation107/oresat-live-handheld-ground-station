3D model of the Handheld Ground Station.

Helical Antenna Segment:
	This antenna is designed to be 100mm on it's longest axis (height).
	It is designed to be printed standing up, with the pins at the top.

	Four of these segments make up a single antenna.

	Works fine with 20% infill, but increasing the wall thickness is recommended,
	especially to fill the pegs.

	Models were originally created with Solidworks. .SLDPRT files, and exported .STL files will live here.

	Dimensions:
		Diameter 39.5mm
		Body Length 93mm
		Peg Length 7mm
		Peg Width 20mm
		Alignment Peg Width 4mm
		Peg Hole Extra Clearance 0.5mm

Backplane:
	Backplane for the antenna, other components attach to it as well.

	Dimensions:
		Minimum Diameter 92mm
		Using 100mm

Atheros AR9271:
	Dimensions:
		Width 17mm
		Length 35.1mm

Phone Holder:
	Three part device that hangs off the backplane to hold the phone.
	Consists of one base, two identical clamps that can be adjusted on the base for different phone sizes.
	Designed to hold the phone in a landscape orientation.

	Dimensions:
		Base 60mm x 100mm x
		Peg Diameter
		Clamps 20mm x 25mm x 100mm (designed to hold max 15mm thick phones)
