Files for 3D printing the antenna.

These files are designed to be 100mm on it's longest axis (height). It is designed to be printed standing up, with the pins at the top.

Four of these segments make up a single antenna.

Works fine with 20% infill, but increasing the wall thickness is recommended, esp to fill the pegs.

Models were originally created with Solidworks, .SLDPRT files, and exported .STL files will live here.
